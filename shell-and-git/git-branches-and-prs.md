## Git Branches & PRs

- A repository (short: repo) is a container for a certain project.
- It is best practice to write commit messages in the present, like for example: "update README.md".
- `pull` zieht nicht nur Daten sondern auch Informationen

### Some useful commands

`git push --set-upstream origin feature/accordion` or short `git push -u origin feature/accordion`
If you want to push a newly created branch to Github for the first time, you need this command.
